Astropolis is a simulation game that explores human expansion and evolution in our own solar system. It is an early stage, open development project created by Charlie Whitfield built in the [I, Voyager](https://www.ivoyager.dev/) solar system simulation using the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/).

Astropolis will be highly moddable. Although it is an open development project, it is not open source. Please see [About](https://t2civ.com/about/) for details.
